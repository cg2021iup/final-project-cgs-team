# 3D Interior Design using Minecraft Blocks 

Our project is that the user or anyone that uses this project will be able to decorate their own minecraft interior using all the blocks that are currently available in the controller, they can stretch the blocks, and they can move the blocks in an X, Y, and Z axis.

We have 13 controllers in our program, there are :
1. addCube
2. removeCube
3. addWoodenPlank
4. addWoodenLog

7. addChest
8. addBookshelf
9. addFurnace
10. addCartographyTable

We also use interactive animation using keyboard, there are :
1. 'W' for Translate
2. 'E' for rotate
3. 'R' for scale
4. '+/-' for adjust size
5. 'Shift' for snip to grid
6. 'X' for Toggle X
7. 'Y' for Toggle Y
8. 'Z' for Toggle Z

In this we added an extra bookshelf in the room and a barrel that floats in the air, the barrel is slightly stretched to the side.
